# BattleShips

Implementation of recruitment task from Guestline: https://medium.com/guestline-labs/hints-for-our-interview-process-and-code-test-ae647325f400

As a reference, I have used instruction: https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Battleship.PDF

# Running the game

__DO NOT RUN THE GAME FROM IDE DEBUGER!__ This breaks gui looks and events.

To run the game, build it, and directly run: CCode.BattleShips.Console.exe

For easy access, use RunGame.bat

Game is interactive and clickable squares will highlight.

Player places shots on Computer Waters.

Game ends when one of players sinks all oponents ships.

Decided to go for "reality based domain models" that are very hard to put in corrupted state.
It is in no way perfect solution, and could be heavily improved uppon, and some parts of it could be reduced, but for porpoises of showing my coding style it is decent enough.
