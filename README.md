# BattleShips

Implementation of recruitment task from Guestline: https://medium.com/guestline-labs/hints-for-our-interview-process-and-code-test-ae647325f400

As a reference, I have used instruction: https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Battleship.PDF

# Running the game

__DO NOT RUN THE GAME FROM IDE DEBUGER!__ This breaks gui looks and events.

To run the game, build it, and directly run: CCode.BattleShips.Console.exe

For easy access, use RunGame.bat
